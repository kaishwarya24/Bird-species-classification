# Bird-species-classification
This study introduces a Deep learning (DL) based
method for classifying ten Indian bird species using acoustic
recordings sourced from the Xeno-Canto database. The dataset,
comprising recordings of varying quality and environmental
conditions, was standardized into WAV format to maintain
uniformity. Essential acoustic features, including Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, spectral con-
trast, Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC) were
extracted to represent the spectral, harmonic, and timbral
characteristics of bird vocalizations. A deep feedforward neu-
ral network, enhanced with regularization and early stopping,
was utilized for classification, delivering high accuracy despite
challenges such as noise and overlapping sounds. The proposed
methodology achieved a remarkable training accuracy of 99%
and testing accuracy of 97% demonstrating the robust performance of the study
